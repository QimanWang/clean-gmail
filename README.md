# clean-gmail
tool to help you get ,delete and unsubscribe your gmail.

## What is this?
I'm annoyed at my 40k+ emails in my gmail box, so I created this tool to analyze my emails.
Then it can show me some useful stats and get the unsubscribe links.

### How to use?
```python
python clean-gmail-data.py
```
It will download all your gmail metadata and store into files by label.

once the data is done, we can get some interesting stats and unsubscribe unwanted emails.

```
python get-gmail-stat.py
```
